# `r emo::ji("globe")` Searching for help online

It goes without saying that internet is useful!

--

For common bugs and error messages, it works great:

1. Copy the error
1. Paste into search bar
1. Add 'R' and 'shiny'
1. Find the answers (probably on StackOverflow!)

--

.sticker-float.img-spin[![](resources/shiny.svg)]

This also works for finding code you *need*!

# `r emo::ji("cat2")` `cat()`/`print()` out app logs

Adding `print()` or `cat()` statements in your reactive code is an easy way to see what your app is doing.

```{r}
current_painting <- reactive({
  cat("Current painting is:", paintings$title[rv$painting])
  paintings[rv$painting,]
})
```

You could also add these logs to the browser's JavaScript console using `shinyjs::logjs()`.

---

.center.box-12.bg-blond[
# `r emo::ji("woman_technologist")` What is the Javascript console? `r emo::ji("man_technologist")`
]

Exactly like your R console, but for Javascript code.

For debugging, it is where JS errors/warnings/messages are found.
If you're writing JS, you can also run code here.

Press F12 in your web browser to open the console/inspector.

---

# `r emo::ji("red_circle")` Add breakpoints to your code

Breakpoints allow you to pause code right where you want.

They can be added by clicking left of the line number (`r emo::ji("red_circle")`), or adding the `browser()` function.

--

Using `browser()` is my preferred method. If is especially useful when used conditionally:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (input$value == something_bad){
  browser()
}
```
---

# `r emo::ji("red_circle")` Add breakpoints to your code

When browsing paused code, you can look and change any code you want.

Some commands are available when browsing code:

* `n`: **N**ext code statement
* `c`: **C**ontinue evaluation
* `f`: **F**inish the current code loop

---

# `r emo::ji("scroll")` Checking the reactive graph

![reactlog](resources/reactivity.gif)

Check materials for the ["reactivity session"](../reactive) if you missed it.

---
background-image: url("resources/showcase.png")
background-size: 40%

# `r emo::ji("framed_picture")` Showcase mode

Showcase mode displays the app alongside its code. Code will be highlighted as it runs on the server.

Enable showcase with `runApp(display.mode = "showcase")`.

--

https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/reactivity.html

---

# `r emo::ji("beetle")` Look for errors in the consoles

Errors in R code will appear in the R console.

--

Errors also previously appeared in the app, however in newer versions of Shiny they will not (for security reasons).

When debugging, you can disable error sanitisation with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(shiny.sanitize.errors = FALSE)
```

Each app has one type of error.

# Avoiding errors

(this also works for any code)

---

# `r emo::ji("dancer")` Code style

<br>

Writing good code won't eliminate errors...

--

.float-right[... but it will make them easier to fix.]

--

<br><br>

---

# `r emo::ji("+1")` Easy code improvements

## 1. Follow a style guide

Having a **consistent style** in your app makes errors stand out.

**Indentation** is especially important for readability of Shiny apps.

.box-12.bg-blond.center[
Code styles are so important that the tidyverse has a style guide book!
https://style.tidyverse.org/
]

The [`styler` package](https://styler.r-lib.org/) can help re-style old code automatically.

---

# `r emo::ji("+1")` Easy code improvements

## 2. Remove code duplication

Code repetition is problematic for many reasons:

* Requires repeated computation
* More places for bugs
* Updating code is a nightmare
* More complex to follow workflow

Replace duplicated code with **reactive expressions**.

---

# `r emo::ji("+1")` Easy code improvements

## 3. Split complex code into smaller steps

A chain of pipes 20 lines long may be impressive...

.float-right[... but it will be harder to debug.]

<br><hr><br>

Small code fragments are easier to verify their correctness.

Each code step should achieve one thing only - avoid side effects if possible.

# `r emo::ji("question")` Why write tests `r emo::ji("question")`

> Even if you don’t, someone will test your software

--

1. Tests indicate failure points of your app.
1. They prevent future changes unknowingly breaking old code.
1. Bugs should only exist once, don't resurrect them.
1. A vote of confidence that your app works as expected.
1. Tests may fail even when your code doesn't - R/packages update, servers change, etc.

---

# `r emo::ji("white_heavy_check_mark")` Testing Shiny apps with shinytest

Creating and running tests for an app takes just three steps:

### 1. Launch the app with test recording

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shinytest)

# Launch the target app (replace with the correct path)
recordTest("path/to/app")
```

--

### 2. Use the app and take snapshots

App usage is tracked on the right, and snapshots store a set of values for comparison.

--

### 3. Check the recorded tests against the app

```{r, eval = FALSE}
testApp("path/to/app")
```

---

# Creating tests for the Bob Ross gallery

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shinytest)
recordTest("../../apps/day_1/gallery/02_gallery/")
```

![testing the gallery](resources/shinytest.png)

---

# `r emo::ji("pray")` Checking that the tests pass

<br><br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(shinytest)
```

```{r}
testApp("../../apps/day_1/gallery/02_gallery/")
```

# `r emo::ji("shooting_star")` Your turn!

## Modify the gallery `r emo::ji("wrench")`

1. Change the ui in any way (perhaps change the title)
1. Re-run the tests

# `r emo::ji("slider")` The shinytest diff tool

Neat tool for visualising changes made to the app.

Are they the changes you want?

![](resources/shinydiff.png)

---

# `r emo::ji("bee")` Testing in a dynamic environment

## Controlling randomness

If your app is random, output will always differ.
For consistent test environments, set the random seed via the recorder UI.

![](resources/shinytest-seed.png)


---

# `r emo::ji("bee")` Testing in a dynamic environment

## Other dynamic app behaviour

When testing, `getOption("shiny.testmode")` will be `TRUE`.

You can use this to load static variables or data sources.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (isTRUE(getOption("shiny.testmode"))) {
  # Load static/dummy data here
} else {
  # Load normal dynamic data here
}
```

---

# `r emo::ji("bee")` Testing in a dynamic environment

## Non-app dynamic environments 

--

1. Web browsers (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge/Other?)
1. Operating systems (Windows/Mac/Other?)
1. Devices (Desktop/Mobile?)
1. Country of origin

<br>

### These 'environment variables' are much harder to test.
