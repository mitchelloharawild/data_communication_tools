# Reactive programming (recap)

---

## `mycode.R`: R script

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- x + 1
x <- 10
# What is y? 6 or 11?
```

A typical R script evaluates code **sequentially**.

`r hr()`

--

## `server.R`: Shiny server

```{r}
r <- reactiveValues()
r$x <- 5
y <- reactive(r$x + 1)
r$x <- 10
# What is y()? 6 or 11?
```

Reactive code in a Shiny server **keeps values up to date**.

---

# `r emo::ji("mag")` Reactive graphs with `reactlog`

The [reactlog package](https://rstudio.github.io/reactlog/) allows you to visualise an app's **reactive graph**.

```{r}
library(reactlog)
```

To **enable logging** of an app's behaviour, set:

```{r}
options(shiny.reactlog = TRUE)
```

Then **start, use, and stop your app** to fill the log. View the log with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reactlogShow()
```

# Reactive sources, conductors and endpoints

![reactive graph explanation](resources/react_log_explained.png)

---

# `r emo::ji("computer")` Reactive values (sources)

`input`: UI defined reactive values allowing user's inputs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
input$InputID # Access a user's value
```

`reactiveValues()`: A list of server defined reactive values.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rv <- reactiveValues(x = TRUE, y = 10)
rv$x # Access a reactive value (creates dependency)
rv$x <- FALSE # Change its value (triggers invalidation)
```

`reactiveVal()`: A single server defined reactive value.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- reactiveVal(TRUE)
x() # Access the reactive value (creates dependency)
x(FALSE) # Change its value (triggers invalidation)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("right_arrow")` Reactive contexts (conductors)

`reactive()`: Reactive expressions for intermediate calculations

```{r, eval = FALSE}
uppercase <- reactive(toupper(input$text))
```

`eventReactive()`: Reactive expressions with trigger events (more control)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
uppercase <- eventReactive(input$submit, toupper(input$text))
# `uppercase()` will only update when `input$submit` changes (user presses a button).
```

---

# `r emo::ji("boom")` Reactive contexts (endpoints)

`render*()`: Functions to produce UI output

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$uppercase <- renderText(toupper(input$text))
```

`observe()`: Trigger arbitrary code on input changes
```{r, eval = FALSE}
observe(print(paste("You clicked submit" input$submit, "times!")))
```

`observeEvent()`: Trigger arbitrary code with trigger events (more control)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
observeEvent(input$submit, print("You clicked submit!"))
```

## Recalling reactivity `r emo::ji("thought")`

Open the Bob Ross gallery (`02_gallery`) app.

1. Add two sliders to the sidebar panel for faster navigation above the buttons
1. The first slider is for the painting's season, the second for the episode
1. Add the server code to make these sliders work with the buttons

Hint 1: There are 31 seasons, each having 13 episodes.

Hint 2: For the buttons to work, the sliders should modify the reactive value.
]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5L)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("flag_in_hole")` Possible solution

### `ui.R`: Add the sliders
```{r, eval = FALSE}
sliderInput("season", "Season:", min = 1, max = 31, value = 1),
sliderInput("episode", "Episode:", min = 1, max = 13, value = 1),
```

### `server.R`: Update the reactive value with observe()

```{r, eval = FALSE}
observe({
  chosen_episode <- sprintf("S%iE%i", input$season, input$episode)
  rv$painting <- match(chosen_episode, paintings$episode)
})
```

# Preventing reactivity

---

# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Event driven reactivity

In the Bob Ross gallery, we used event triggers for the buttons.

```{r}
observeEvent(input$btn_previous, {
  rv$painting <- max(1, rv$painting - 1)
})

observeEvent(input$btn_next, {
  rv$painting <- min(NROW(paintings), rv$painting + 1)
})
```

---

# `r emo::ji("sparkles")` Event driven reactivity

What is the issue if we had used `observe()` instead?

```{r}
observe({
  if (input$btn_previous > 0){
    rv$painting <- max(1, rv$painting - 1)
  }
})

observe({
  if (input$btn_next > 0){
    rv$painting <- min(NROW(paintings), rv$painting + 1)
  }
})
```

.center.bg-blond.box-12[
Not sure? Replace the app code and try it for yourself.
]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 1L)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("infinity")` Beware of the infinite loop!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
observe({
  if (input$btn_previous > 0){
    rv$painting <- max(1, rv$painting - 1) #<<
  }
})
```

--

The observers are reacting to their own change to `rv$painting`!

Updating the reactive value causes a loop, which could crash your app.

--

Previously, `observeEvent()` only updated on the button press event and ignored the change to the reactive value.

---

# Isolating reactive scopes

Event triggers are not available everywhere, and side-effects from `observeEvent()` lead to confusing/bad code.

You can also prevent reactivity using `isolate()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
observe({
  if (input$btn_previous > 0){
    rv$painting <- max(1, isolate(rv$painting) - 1) #<<
  }
})
```

The observer now ignores updates to rv$painting when determining it's reactivity.

## Compare reactive graphs for the above methods `r emo::ji("thought")`

Open the Bob Ross gallery (`03_gallery`) app.

1. Create a reactive graph for the button functionality
1. Modify the buttons to use the (wrong) looping code
1. How does the reactive graph differ?
1. What about if we use isolate(rv$painting) instead?

]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3L)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("racehorse")` Rate limiting (debounce/throttle)

We can also *prevent* reactive triggers happening too frequently.

* Some input updates trigger updates rapidly (typing, sliding).
* Rate limiting prevents/modifies reactivity during input changes.

--

<br>

.box-12.bg-blond.center[
This is important if our code is slow/expensive!

The user doesn't want to wait while adjusting inputs.
]


---

# `r emo::ji("racehorse")` Rate limiting (debounce/throttle)

Shiny has inbuilt rate limiting, but this often isn't enough.

There are two rate limiting functions:

* `throttle()`: Throttle limits how frequently updates occur  
  `ooo-oo-oo---- => o--o--o--o---`

* `debounce()`: Debounce ignores changes until the changes stop  
  `ooo-oo-oo---- => -----------o-`

--

These functions only work on **reactive expressions** (`reactive()`).

To rate limit an input, you'll need to use `debounce(reactive(input$???), millis)`.

---
class: feature

# `r emo::ji("shooting_star")` Your turn!

.box-12[
## Rate limit the 'Hello {{name}}' app `r emo::ji("racehorse")`

Open the `hello_rate_limit` app.

1. Add debounced and throttled expressions for the name
1. Create text renderers for the new text outputs
1. Start with a 1 second time throttle/debounce window
1. Use the app and compare outputs as you type
1. Increase the time window to exaggerate the effect
]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 2L, seconds = 30L)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("stop_sign")` Stopping reactivity

A reactive chain can be stopped using `req()`.

You usually want to stop reactive chains when its inputs will cause errors.

Bad inputs are especially common when the app is initialised, as some more dynamic inputs may not be available yet (giving a `NULL` value).

# Other reactive triggers

---

# `r emo::ji("file_folder")` File monitoring and polling

`reactiveFileReader()` checks for file modification, and triggers data updates.

This is particularly important when working with a continuous flow of data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
app_data <- reactiveFileReader(
  intervalMillis = 1000, session,
  filePath = "data/app.csv",
  readFunc = read_csv)
app_data()
```

This function will only work with a single file source on the local disk.

---

# `r emo::ji("file_folder")` File monitoring and polling

`reactivePoll()` is more general, but requires a bit more work.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
reactivePoll(intervalMillis, session, checkFunc, valueFunc)
```

It allows you to update `valueFunc` based on changes to `checkFunc`.

For example, your data may be spread across multiple files. New data is added daily by adding a new file.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
app_data <- reactivePoll(
  intervalMillis = 1000*60*60, session, 
  checkFunc = function() length(list.files("data")),
  valueFunc = function() map_dfr(list.files("data"), read_csv))
app_data()
```

---

# `r emo::ji("watch")` Time based reactivity

Suppose we wanted to make a clock for our app.

We tried this code for our app, but it doesn't work:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  "The time is:",
  textOutput("time")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  now <- reactive({ Sys.time() })
  output$time <- renderText({format(now(), format = "%H:%M:%S")})
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Why doesn't the time update?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 0L, seconds = 30L)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("watch")` Time based reactivity

The clock doesn't update, because `now()` never invalidates.

--

Time-based invalidation can be triggered using `invalidateLater()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  "The time is:",
  textOutput("time")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  now <- reactive({
    invalidateLater(1000) #<<
    Sys.time() 
  })
  output$time <- renderText({format(now(), format = "%H:%M:%S")})
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

# `r emo::ji("shooting_star")` Your turn!

.box-12[
## Painting carousel `r emo::ji("framed_picture")`

Add the server code for a carousel feature in `04_gallery`.

1. The carousel should only run if the carousel mode is checked.
1. The speed slider should set the seconds each painting is shown.
1. Once the carousel has reached the last painting, the gallery should start again from the first painting.

]

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 3L)
```

---

# `r emo::ji("flag_in_hole")` Possible solution

<br>

### `server.R`: Add the carousel feature

```{r}
  observe({
    # If the carousel mode is enabled
    if(input$carousel_enable){
      # Invalidate this observer in a few seconds
      invalidateLater(input$carousel_speed * 1000)
      # Show the next painting
      rv$painting <- (isolate(rv$painting)) %% NROW(paintings) + 1
    }
  })
```

---
class: topic-starter, center

# Dynamic user interface

---

# `r emo::ji("arrows_counterclockwise")` The need for a dynamic user interface

Much like how outputs can be set using the server, it is also possible to **change inputs and layouts using the server**.

We can use this to provide the most relevant information to the user.

<hr>

--

There's a few problems with the new features added to the Bob Ross gallery.

1. The season/episode sliders don't stay updated when the image changes.
1. We're lucky that all 31 seasons have 13 episodes, but what if they didn't?
1. There's no need to see the carousel speed if carousel mode isn't enabled.

---

# `r emo::ji("inbox_tray")` Updating inputs from the server

All shiny inputs have a server driven update function.

These functions allow you to change an input's current and allowable values.

<hr>

--

For example, using `updateTextInput()` it is possible to make the user's inputted name use capital letters.

```{r}
observe({
  updateTextInput(session, "name", value = toupper(input$name))
})
```

---

# `r emo::ji("computer")` Dynamic UI

Much like a plot is added with `plotOutput()` and `renderPlot()`...

.float-right[... UI elements can be added with `uiOutput()` and `renderUI()`!]

<br><hr>

--

This simple feature allows for sophisticated dynamic interfaces.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# ui.R
uiOutput("performance")

# server.R
output$performance <- renderUI({
  if (input$user == "employee") {
    # Show employee dashboard
  }
  if (input$user == "manager") {
    # Show manager dashboard
  }
})
```

# `r emo::ji("shooting_star")` Your turn!

.box-12[
## Make the gallery interface dynamic `r emo::ji("arrows_counterclockwise")`

Open the Bob Ross gallery (`05_gallery`) app.

1. Use `updateSliderInput()` to always keep the slider's values updated
1. Use `uiOutput()`/`renderUI()` to hide the carousel speed when not used

Hint 1: Returning NULL in `renderUI()` will produce no output.

Hint 2: When you first enable the carousel, `input$carousel_speed` does not yet exist. You should stop the reactive chain when `input$carousel` has an invalid value.
