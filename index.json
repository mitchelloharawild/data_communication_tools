Welcome to Interactive documents with Shiny, pretty soon we‚Äôll meet for the two day workshop. üêù\nBefore seeing me at the workshop, please follow the steps below to make sure everything is installed and ready to go:\nIf you haven‚Äôt previously used tidyverse packages such as ggplot2 or dplyr, learn the basics of data transformation and visualisation. A good resource for this is Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham‚Äôs R for Data Science book.\n Please bring a laptop that has the following installed:\n A recent version of R (\u0026gt;=3.6.0), which is available for free at https://cloud.r-project.org/\n A recent version of RStudio Desktop (\u0026gt;=1.2), available for free (RStudio Desktop Open Source License)\n The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running at the command line:\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;shiny\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;reactlog\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;shinytest\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;usethis\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;shinycssloaders\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;shinydashboard\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;shinyWidgets\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mapdeck\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;DT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gt\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;shinythemes\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;shinyjs\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;leaflet\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;plotly\u0026quot;))  Bring along a shiny app that you‚Äôve worked on before and would like to improve. If you haven‚Äôt created a shiny app, you can bring an R script or idea that can an app can be created for.\n  During the workshop I‚Äôll provide instructions on how you can download and set up the course material.\n","date":1572220800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572220800,"objectID":"db6d219a86ca29b68193d0e34c830e24","permalink":"/materials/prepare/","publishdate":"2019-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/materials/prepare/","section":"materials","summary":"Welcome to this workshop!
